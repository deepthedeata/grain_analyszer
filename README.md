# Raice labz – UI Wireframe (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Pages
- `index.html` – Dashboard (with Brokens hover → Tibar/Dubar/Mongra/Mini Mongra/Nakku)
- `grain.html` – Tell us about grain (dynamic blocks by analysis type + region)
- `segmentation.html` – Segmentation config (North region only)
- `live.html` – Live Analysis (weight vs count basis + moisture only for procurement)
- `reports.html` – Reports with filters (includes Variety filter)
- `settings.html` – Settings tables with add-row buttons

## Run
Open `index.html` directly in browser OR use a simple local server:

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Notes
This is a front-end wireframe/demo only (no backend). Hook APIs later for real data.
